We support the creation of notebooks without the ambition
to release software via PyPI.
The approach taken here is very suitable for computational experiments.
The repo is not minimalistic but comes with a curated set of pre-commit hooks
and follows modern and established guidelines.

* 🚀 Uses uv for dependency management
* ✅ Offers a list of curated pre-commit hooks
* 🔄 GitHub Actions for continuous integration
* 🧹 Code formatting with ruff
* 📊 Interactive notebooks with marimo
